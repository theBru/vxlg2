Green background with a gold disc on the top hoist half with a palm tree; a gold crescent at the centre and the Southern Cross in the fly half.

Green and gold are national colours of Australia; the crescent represents Islam, which is the religion of the majority of the islands' population; and Southern Cross represents Australia. (<span class="source-link">[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Cocos_(Keeling)_Islands)</span>)
