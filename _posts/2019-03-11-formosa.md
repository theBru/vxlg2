*Flag proportions*: 6:11

Sky blue background with an inverted white triangle on the fly end. A circle of nine four-pointed stars, with green laurels going across the top.

The white triangle represents the Southern Cone; the laurels represent the Tropic of Capricorn; stars represent the four administrative divisions of the province; and sky blue is from the national flag. (<span class="source-link">[1](https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ar-p.html#descr)</span>)
