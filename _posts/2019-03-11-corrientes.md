A triband with two horizontal sky blue bands sandwiching a white band, with a sky blue triangle whose base is flush against the hoist side. A rising Inca god of sun on a thin oval emblem with sky blue and white horizontal bands, with two shaking hands holding a stick with a red cap above a burning cross atop a mountain range. The emblem is surrounded by a couple of wreaths, sitting on the white band. The words "Patria - Libertad - Constitucion" arc over the emblem.
