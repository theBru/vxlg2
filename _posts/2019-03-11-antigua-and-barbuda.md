*Flag proportions*: 2:3

Red field with an inverted black triangle of horizontal tricolour of black, blue, and white, with a rising sun on the black band.

There are various intepretations of the colours. Black is for the nation's African ancestry; blue for hope; and red for the energy of the people. The yellow, blue and white also represent the sun, sea, and sand. The V-shaped of the inverted triangle stands for victory.
