![Flag of Algeria](/assets/img/{{ page.image }})

Two equal vetical bars of green and white, with a red crescent surrounding a five-pointed star in the centre.

Green is the traditional colour of Islam, while white traditionally stands for purity. Crescent and five-pointed star also feature in flags of other Islamic countries. The crescent and star are also taken from the Turkish flag. (<span class="source-link">[1](http://flagpedia.net/algeria)</span>)
