*Flag proportions*: 2:3

Vertical tricolour of green, white, and blue, with the Inca god of sun on the white band atop a plough surrounded by 25 gold stars.

Blue and white bands and the sun are taken from the national flag; plough represents labour; and 25 stars represent the departments of the province. (<span class="source-link">[1](https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ar-h.html#descr)</span>)
