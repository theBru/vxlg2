A red field with the region's coat of arms at the centre. The coat of arms is a gold shield, surrounded by gold oak and laurel branches, tied with a blue ribbon at the bottom. On the shield are green hills and three stalks with red ears growing out of them, with the Virgin Mary holding baby Jesus against a blue disc.
