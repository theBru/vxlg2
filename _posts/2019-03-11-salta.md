Burgundy background with two thin black stripes going across the top and bottom halves. An oval emblem at the centre with a sky blue background and a white six-pointed star and the Indian god of sun against a sky blue background. The emblem is surrounded by 23 six-pointed stars.

Burgundy is the colour of the ponchos of gauchos during the war for independence; black stripes represent mourning. (<span class="source-link">[1](https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ar-a.html#descr)</span>)
