*Flag proportions*: 15:21

Triband with horizontal bands of white, red, and white, with a dark blue canton charged with twenty-five white five-pointed-stars.

The stars represent the state's municipalities in 1897. White represents hope, red overcoming difficulties, and blue skies. (<span class="source-link">[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Amazonas)</span>)
