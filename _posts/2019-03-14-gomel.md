The coat of arms feature a red ribbon wrapped with gold oak branches, surrounding a shield with a castle at the crown, a silver Maltese cross with depictions of an archer, a black eagle, a purple flag featuring a knight, and a black horn on each arm. At the centre of the cross is a gold lynx on a blue field.
