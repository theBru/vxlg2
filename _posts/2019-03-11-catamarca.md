*Flag proportions*: 1:2

Two rectangles of light blue and white on top of a wide red band, surrounded by a golden frame. The Inca god of sun at the centre surrounded by two olive branches.

Blue is taken from the national flag; white represents the mantle of the Virgin; red represents the blood of the people. Each leaf of the olive branches represent the departments of the province. The gold band is the cultural heritage of the province. (<span class="source-link">[1](https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ar-k.html#descr))
