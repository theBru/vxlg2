*Flag proportions*: 2:3

Triband with three horizontal bands of blue, white, and green. On the blue band, hoist-side, there is a black rectangle with a circle of 13 white five-pointed stars.

Blue represents justice and the water resources of the province; white stands for unity; green stands for hope and agricultural wealth of the land; black harks back to the name of the province. (<span class="source-link">[1](https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ar-r.html#flag)</span>)
