*Flag proportions*: 2:3

Divided from lower hoist to upper fly; lower half is dark blue, while upper half has a white fess sinister and a yellow triangle against upper hoist. The white fess is charged with a red six-pointed star surrounded by a black compass outline.

Blue represents sea, white represents sky, and yellow represents the Sun. The six-pointed star represents the original six villages of Bonaire. (<span class="source-link">[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Bonaire)</span>)
