*Flag proportions*: 2:3

A triband with two horizontal sky blue bands sandwiching a white band. The emblem that sits at the centre of the white band is a curved triangle with two horizontal bands of blue and green. There is a tree on the blue and a native on a horse on the green band. The triangle is bordered by two golden wreaths, with a ribbon of blue and white at the bottom end and two spears diagonally behind it. 

The blue on the emblem stands for justice, perseverance, and loyalty; green stands for hope, hospitality, and politeness. The tree is common to the province and the native represents the old inhabitants of the area. (<span class="source-link">[1](https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ar-l.html#coa)</span>)
