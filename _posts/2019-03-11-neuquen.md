Triband with two vertical sky blue bands sandwiching a white band. The coat of arms at the centre of the white band is a circle with the volcano Lanín as a backdrop, local pehuen tree in the forefront. Two laurel branches surround the lower part of the circle and join at an eight-pointed star. The top of the circle is bordered by 17 golden five-pointed stars.
