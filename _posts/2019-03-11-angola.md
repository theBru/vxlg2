![Flag of Angola](/assets/img/{{ page.image }})

*Flag proportions*: 2:3

Two horizontal stripes of red and black, with a enmblem made up of a gear, a five-pointed star, and a machete (all yellow) off-centre.

Red represents the blood shed for Angola's independence and the black represents Africa. The gear represents industrial workers, the star represents socialism, and the machete represents the peasantry. (<span class="source-link">[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Angola)</span>)
