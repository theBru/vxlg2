![Flag of Afghanistan](/assets/img/{{ page.image }})

_Flag proportions:_ 2:3

Trioclour with vertical bands of black, red, and green, with the national coat of arms in the centre. 

Black represents the era when the country was occupied; red represents the blood shed by those who fought for independence; and green represents victory. (<span class="source-link">[1](https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-Afghanistan)</span>)

Black was also predominantly used in previous Afghan flags; red might be a reference to the Soviet flag; and green is treaditionally used to represent Islam. (<span class="source-link">[2](https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/af.html#col)</span>)
